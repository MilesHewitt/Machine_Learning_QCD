## To view the analysis
A shortened report of the dissertation is available at ['Introduction to machine learning regression applications in quantum chromodynamics'](https://www.mileshewitt.com/projects/mlqcd)

## To run the analysis for yourself and obtain results
Running the 'Form_Dataset.py' file in '/set-up-files' will create and save the artificial dataset used to produce the results I have obtained. 

One can run the 'Ridge_Regression_Hyperparameter.py' to obtain the best hyperparameter for ridge regression for the particular dataset formed. For kernel ridge regression
